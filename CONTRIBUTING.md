# Contributing Guide

## Principles
- Trust > plausibility. Structure > style.
- Reproducibility over demos.

## How to contribute
1. Open an issue describing the change and its impact on trust/CSR/HRR.
2. Fork → branch (`feat/…`, `fix/…`, `docs/…`).
3. Add tests or graders if behavior changes.
4. Submit a PR with a clear rationale and examples.

## Commit style
- English, imperative:
  - `feat(psl): add CONFIDENCE field`
  - `docs(geobench): meal-planner grader notes`

## Code of conduct
See `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`.
