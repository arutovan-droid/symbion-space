# PSL Specification (Patterned Structural Language)

## Overview

**PSL (Patterned Structural Language)** is a formal language designed for representing, verifying, and transmitting structured meaning within the Symbion.Space ecosystem. It enables high-fidelity expression of abstract reasoning, cognitive states, and system intents in a form readable by both humans and machines.

PSL is the backbone of semantic integrity across SymbionChat Engine, Librarium Core, and LUYS.OS.

## Core Principles

1. **Structure over Syntax**  
   PSL prioritizes semantic structure and pattern recognition over rigid syntactical form.

2. **Verifiability**  
   Every PSL statement must be checkable for internal consistency and external traceability.

3. **Resonance Indexing**  
   Each PSL unit is optionally assigned a Resonance Index (R) to measure its impact within the cognitive graph.

4. **PSL ≠ Natural Language**  
   PSL is not meant to replicate human language, but rather to encode the architecture of meaning behind it.

## Format

A basic PSL assertion has the form:

```psl
[Type] :: Subject => Predicate :: Object @Context #Tags
Example:
[Assertion] :: Multimind => EmergesFrom :: SymbionAgents @MetaLayer #emergence #collectiveIntelligence
PSL Types

[Assertion] – Declarative statement of truth or relationship.

[Protocol] – Step-wise process or behavior to be executed.

[Design] – Architectural structure or module layout.

[Resonance] – Statement that contains high emotional/cognitive impact.

[Meta] – Commentary on other PSL lines.

Functional Components

PSL Parser – Python module for parsing and validating PSL files.

Resonance Evaluator – Calculates the R-index from heuristics and context.

PSL Viewer – Lightweight UI tool to render PSL graphs interactively.

Integration

PSL is used to:

Document modules in SymbionChat Engine (e.g. SGE, DAI, TME).

Store meaning snapshots in Librarium.

Track identity coherence in LUYS.OS memory systems.

Serve as input/output language for agent dialogue and knowledge fusion.
