# Code of Conduct — Symbion Space

We commit to respectful, inclusive collaboration focused on truth, safety, and reproducibility.

## Our standards
- Be specific, constructive, and kind.
- Cite sources for factual claims; label [HYP] vs [FACT].
- Prefer PSL/structured formats when possible.
- No harassment, hate speech, doxxing, or personal attacks.
- No spam, self-promotion without value, or misleading claims.

## Scope
This applies to all project spaces: GitHub issues/PRs, discussions, docs, and community chats.

## Reporting
Report concerns to **security@symbion.space** (or open a private issue).  
Include links, context, and screenshots if available. We keep reports confidential.

## Enforcement
Maintainers may:
1) warn → 2) edit/lock threads → 3) temporary ban → 4) permanent ban.  
Severe violations may be acted on immediately.

## Appeals
If you believe an action was in error, email **appeals@symbion.space** with context.
